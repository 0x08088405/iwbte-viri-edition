# I Wanna Be The Engine: viri edition ‚ú®

A small engine on top of YoYoGames' [GameMaker](https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker) for creating *I Wanna Be The Guy* fangames, developed due to the lack of lightweight & user-friendly engines available for  **GameMaker: Studio v1.x**.

## Overview
### Features ‚≠ê

- Plays just like the established **yuuutu** engine, no need to worry about using a nonstandard engine!
- **NO SOLIDS!** Yeah, that disgusting abomination of a GameMaker feature is gone. Yay!
- The entire project is created in pure GameMaker Language (GML) and is cross-platform.
- Designed to be very simple to understand, modify and be highly customizable.
- Minimal sound system & mixer built on top of the basic audio interface.
- Debug hotkeys: godmode, saving, gravity, room switching, fps set, v-align set
- Debug overlay: room, player coordinates (with v-align), h-align, fps / fps_real
- No unnecessary files included: Compact <200kB **.gmz** download

## Setup
### Downloads & Getting Started üì∞

You can grab the latest version
[here](https://github.com/notviri/iwbte-viri-edition/releases/download/v0.9/IWBTE.Viri.Edition.v0_9.gmz)
*(pre-release, v0.9)* although this is far behind the current version!
  
It's recommended you use **GameMaker: Studio v1.4.1757** as versions after that had reported framerate bugs in game builds ran on Windows 10. You can download this specific version from the official YoYoGames servers [here](http://store.yoyogames.com/downloads/gm-studio/GMStudio-Installer-1.4.1757.exe) ([mirror](https://mega.nz/#!Ayh2maAA!V9N_7ROqbfeyQ2_NQOqyiptjb9dp6j94EAsHEsPSyq0)), and just select not to upgrade when prompted to download the newest version. **Warning:** Using 1.4.1757 will give you a few errors on launch since the GameMaker: Studio v1.x frontpage, along with the RSS feed has been taken down! Just click the errors away and it will work fine.

To get started, open GameMaker and import the *.gmz* contents with the **Import project...** option. This'll allow you to create a new project from the *.gmz* provided.
**Do not** open this *.gmz* directly as it won't give you the option to select where it's imported to, or what the project name is, and if you had two *.gmz* files with the same name they could even conflict in the same folder and it won't even ask you.

Tutorials & examples can be found in the docs. Have fun! ‚ù§
