# I Wanna Be The Engine: viri edition âœ¨

A small engine on top of YoYoGames' [GameMaker](https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker) for creating *'I Wanna Be The Guy'* fangames, created due to the lack of lightweight & user-friendly engines available for  **GameMaker: Studio v1.x**.

## Downloads & Setup

You can grab the latest version
[here](https://github.com/notviri/iwbte-viri-edition/releases/download/v0.9/IWBTE.Viri.Edition.v0_9.gmz)
*(pre-release, v0.9)*.

Go to GameMaker and import the *.gmz* contents with the **Import project...** option. This'll allow you to create a new project from the *.gmz* provided.
**Do not** open this *.gmz* directly as it won't give you the option to select where it's imported to, or what the project name is, and if you had two *.gmz* files with the same name they could even conflict in the same folder and it won't even ask you.
